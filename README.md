ðŸš€ Spacecraft Builder

Overview

The Spacecraft Builder is a React application that allows users to design a spacecraft by adding and managing items in an inventory. Users can input an itemâ€™s name, quantity, and purpose, and the app dynamically updates the inventory. Items can also be removed from the inventory.

This project is an exercise in React forms, focusing on:
â€¢ Controlled components
â€¢ Form validation
â€¢ State management
â€¢ Parent-child component communication

ðŸ›  Features

âœ… Add items to an inventory with a name, quantity, and purpose
âœ… Display inventory items dynamically
âœ… Remove items from the inventory
âœ… Basic form validation to ensure required fields are filled
âœ… Component-based architecture

ðŸ’» Technologies Used
â€¢ React â€“ Component-based UI framework
â€¢ CSS Modules â€“ Scoped component styling
â€¢ UUID â€“ Generating unique IDs for inventory items
â€¢ PropTypes â€“ Type checking for React props

ðŸ“Œ How It Works

    1.	Users fill out the form in ItemForm.jsx and submit an item.
    2.	The parent component (SpacecraftBuilder.jsx) updates the inventory state.
    3.	The inventory is displayed in InventoryDisplay.jsx, where each item is shown using ItemCard.jsx.
    4.	Users can remove items using ItemAction.jsx, which triggers the delete function in SpacecraftBuilder.jsx.
